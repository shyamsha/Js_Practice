// prototype allows javascript objects to inherit from one and another
const vehicle = {
  drive() {
    console.log("the car is driving");
  },
};

const car = {
  make: "Honda",
};

// car is going to be prototype of type vehicle essentially tells inherit from vehicle to car
// drive method also available inside car
Object.setPrototypeOf(car, vehicle);
car.drive();
console.log(car.make);

// every javascript function is by default prototype and we can attach properties and methods to prototype
// when you want to implement inheritance and prototype property not accessible in for/in loops.

function PrintStuff(myDocs) {
  this.docs = myDocs;
}

// we can add one method to printStuff prototype properties so other instances(objects) can inherit
PrintStuff.prototype.print = function () {
  console.log(this.docs);

// creating new obj to printStuff constructor inherit printStuff properties and methods.
let newObj = new PrintStuff("Iam new obj I can print");
// like this way inherit all properties and methods in simple example.

newObj.print(); //I am new obj I can print

// second concept is prototype attribute
// prototype attributes of object created with new Object() or object constructor.

1; //prototype based inheritance implement

function Plant() {
  (this.country = "India"), (this.isOrganic = true);
}
// adding properties or methods via prototype
Plant.prototype.a = "a";
let p = new Plant();
console.log(p.a);
Plant.prototype.amIOrganic = function () {
  if (this.isOrgan) {
    console.log("i am organic");
  }
};

Plant.prototype.showNameColor = function () {
  console.log(this.name + " is a " + this.color);
};
// creating another constructor that inherit form plant

function Fruit(fruitName, fruitColor) {
  this.name = fruitName;
  this.color = fruitColor;
}

// set Fruit prototype to plant constructor this inherit plant all properties and methods
Fruit.prototype = new Plant();

// creating object from fruit
let mango = new Fruit("Mango", "Yellow");

// the mango objects inherit form both plant and fruit properties and methods
// because fruit prototype which is plant prototype
mango.showNameColor(); // Mango is a Yellow
console.log(mango.country); // India

2; //prototype chain
// if you want to access a property of an object,
// the search for the property begins directly on the object.
// If the JS runtime can’t find the property there,
// it then looks for the property on the object’s prototype—the object it inherited its properties from.
// If the property is not found on the object’s prototype,
// the search for the property then moves to prototype of the object’s prototype (the father of the object’s father—the grandfather).
// And this continues until there is no more prototype (no more great-grand father; no more lineage to follow).
// This in essence is the prototype chain: the chain from an object’s prototype to its prototype’s prototype and onwards.
// And JavaScript uses this prototype chain to look for properties and methods of an object.

String.prototype.specify = function () {
  return this.split("").join(" ");
};
console.log("hello world".specify()); // h e l l o   w o r l d
