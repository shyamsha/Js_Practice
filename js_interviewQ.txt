primitive :- String,number,null,Undefined,symbol,boolean
non-primitive/object type :- objects,array,date

Question 6:- Explain Undefined Data types ?
variable has been declare but value is not assigned

Question 7:- What is Null ?
null indicates absence of data. its not zero or empty. it is primitive datatype.

Question 8:- Differentiate between Null and Undefined ?
Undefined :-variable has been declare but value is not assigned

Question 12:- What are the issues with Global variables ?
hard to debug

Question 13:- What happens when you declare variable with out VAR ?
it will become global variable
Question 14:- What is Use Strict ?
JavaScript's strict mode is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of JavaScript, thereby implicitly opting-out of "sloppy mode".

Question 15:- How to force developers to use Var keyword ?// strick

Question 16:- How can we handle Global Variables ?
Question 17:- How can we avoid Global variables ?
using Closures

Question 18:- What are Closures ?
check clouser.js
Question 19:- Why do we need Closures ?
create self contain function and state and solve global variable problem
Question 20:- Explain IIFE ?
it is anonymous function it invoke immediately

Question 21:- What is the use of IIFE ?
solve name  collision 

Question 22:- What is name collision in global scope ?
name same variables or functions in same context

Question 23:- IIFE vs Normal Function?
normal function have name collision IIFE does not

Question 24:- What are design patterns ?
design patterns are time tested architecture. if we going to object uses singleton pattern

Question 25:- Which is the most used design pattern?
module design pattern or revealing module pattern

Question 26:- What is module Pattern and revealing module pattern ?
self contain independent components
provide encapsulation and abstraction

Question 29:- What is prototype in JavaScript ?
every object has prototype object

Question 30:- Explain Prototype chaining ?
means where one object inheritance to another object

Question 31:- What is Let Keyword?
block level scope, we can not re declare

Question 32:- Are Let variables hoisted ?
they are hoisted but not initialization

Question 33:- Explain Temporal Dead Zone ?
variables are declared before initialization access those variables in the state of period is TDZ.
those variables in memory but not have assigned values

Question 34:- Let vs Var
scope, declare, initialization

Question 35:- String Concatenation and Arithmetic puzzle
with "+" symbol to type caste

How to detect if caps lock is on using JavaScript?
use the getModifierState() method of the KeyboardEvent event object.

What is context API VS Redux?
Redux is a complete state manager capable of allowing an app to undo/redo actions and provides advanced developer tooling for debugging. 
Context API is designed as a dependency injection mechanism that allows making data available through the component tree without being manually passed

Question 36 :- What is class in ES6 ?


Question 37 :- So with class Keyword does it imply JavaScript is a OOP language ?


Question 38 :- Differentiate between class and normal function ?


Question 39 :- What is a Arrow function ?


Question 40 :- Why do we use Arrow function ?


Question 41 :- Differentiate between Arrow vs Normal Function ?


Question 42 :- Does Arrow function create its own this ?


Question 43. Explain Synchronous execution ?


Question 44. What is a call Stack ?
Question 45. What is a blocking call ?
Question 46. How to avoid blocking calls ?
Question 47. Explain Asynchronous execution ?
Question 48. Synch vs Asynch ?
Question 49. How can we do Asynch calls ?
Question 50. What is a thread ?
Question 51. Explain Multi-threading ?
Question 52. Is JavaScript Multi-threaded ?
Question 53. Then how does Settimeout run ?
Question 54. What is a WebAPI/Browser API ?
Question 55. What is a Event loop and callback queue?
Question 56. Eventloop and Callback code question?

JavaScript runtime (Browser)

What will be the output of the following code snippet? (in operator)

const first = 2 in [1, 2]; // return false in array we have give index not value of index
const second = '2' in [0, 1, 2]; // return true
console.log("length" in first); // returns true (length is an Array property)
console.log(Symbol.iterator in first); // returns true
console.log(first, second); 

const myCar = { make: "Honda", model: "Accord", year: 1998 };
"make" in myCar; // returns true
"model" in myCar; // returns true

const color1 = new String("green"); // creating new string object
"length" in color1; // returns true

const color2 = "coral";
// generates an error (color2 is not a String object)
"length" in color2;
