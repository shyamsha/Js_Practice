1.what are new tags of html5?
there are several tags. 
some of the tags are aside,article,datalist,canvas,date,datetime,audio,video,color inputs are some of new tags.

2.should we inject div tag inside of span tag?
yes, div is block scope and span is inline tag but schematically wrong it will break in production

3.5 ways center align image inside div?
flex box,grid,table css,margin css, position css

4.px vs em vs rem?
px is absolute value and it is  fixed size
em is scalable elements that needs to change size relative to parent element
rem is scalable responsive layout that needs to change size relative to root element

5.name all basic data types?
there are two types one is primitive and another is non-primitive
primitive--string,boolean,number,null,undefined,bigint,symbol
non-primitive--array,object,date

6.what is event delegation and bubbling and capturing?
event delegation is pattern to handle events efficiently.
Instead of add event listener to each and every similar element we can add event to parent element. 
call an event on particular target using event.target property of object to perform a task
bubbling--when element receives event happens its bubbles up to parent element and ancestor element on dom until get root element
capturing is opposite of bubbling

7.what is closure and uses?
closure is combination of function bundled together with reference to surrounding state. it means lexical environment
simply means a child function can access parent scope even if parent function closed.
usages memorization and currying

8.what is need of js frameworks?
to help you to design web applications. it has flexibility and scalable and code readability and plugins and builds-->production,development... 

9.VDOM vs DOM?
DOM is document object modal and it represents document tree structure of HTML
React follows observable pattern
VDOM is memory representation of DOM means exact copy of DOM
if react changes state in component and it update VDOM but not in DOM.
after updating react compares previous version of VDOM and current version of VDOM
react knows exactly which nodes changed in VDOM.those nodes only changed in real DOM
this process is diffing algorithm VDOM is faster because of making minimal manipulating operations 

10.component lifecycle methods and order?
there phases mounting and updating and unmounting
constructor
getderivedstatefromprops
shouldcomponentupdate
render
componentdidmount
componentdidupdate
componentwillunmount

11.pure components vs HOC components?
pure components work like functional components there is one difference that is shouldcomponentupdate lifecycle method.
it is checking on every render shallow comparison of state and props if it difference should render component other wise should not
HOC is component it takes another component as argument and returns new component. it is pattern from compositional nature
we don't modify components we create new ones
it is useful for code reuse
props manipulating
it is pure function. It ha no side effects. return new components only
for example show loading when user fetching data so wa can create HOC achieve it
react-redux --> connect
react-router--> withRouter
material-ui-->	withStyles(styles)(UserPage)

12.HOF functions?
HOF takes function as argument returns another function. they enable us abstract over actions not values
for example map,foreach,filter

13.state vs props vs ref?
state is object that stores information and owned by component and locally scoped
state can mutable via setState
props is object that have information
props passing down child components and it immutable
ref are accessing DOM elements without using selector methods of the document object
ref create like useRef hook createRef using class-based components
use-cases of refs are maintaining input focus,text selection,media controls,outside dom,wth third party libraries

14.version of react?
react 18 features for automatic batch updates, useTransition startTransition  A transition is a new concept in React to distinguish between urgent and non-urgent updates.
support for Suspense on the server,New Strict Mode Behaviors, new hooks

15.functional component vs class component?
functional component is pure functional in javascript
we can maintaining stateful using hooks 
class component extend from react and it has render method return children and class component has lifecycle methods

16.Why it is Recommended to use Functional Components over Class Components?
simplicity
performance
code readability
easier to test
we can make stateful and lifecycle methods using hooks

17.Is the Shadow DOM the same as the Virtual DOM?
No, they are different. The Shadow DOM is a browser technology designed primarily for scoping variables and CSS in web components. 
The virtual DOM is a concept implemented by libraries in JavaScript on top of browser APIs.

18.what are fragments?
