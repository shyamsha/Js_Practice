Temporal dead zone
A temporal dead zone (TDZ) is the area of a block where a variable is inaccessible.
ex if you access variable before initialization it throws error Cannot access 'a' before initialization

null vs undefined
undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value :

var testVar;
console.log(testVar); //shows undefined
console.log(typeof testVar); //shows undefined

null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value :

var testVar = null;
console.log(testVar); //shows null
console.log(typeof testVar); //shows object
Expand snippet
From the preceding examples, it is clear that undefined and null are two distinct types: 
undefined is a type itself (undefined) while null is an object.

Map and filter and reduce 
map returns new array from existing array. applying function to each element transforms into new array.
filter returns new array from existing array. applying condition to each element and if condition satisfy push to element to array and returns
reduce has accumulator,current values reduce can makes array values down to just single value

Closures 
A closure is a combination of function and with reference to the surrounding state means the lexical environment
It simply means child function will access to parent scope even if parent function is closed 
it allows for private variables and function level encapsulation
function outer() {
  let privateVar = 0;
  return function inner() {
    privateVar++;
    console.log(privateVar);
  };
}
const closureFunc = outer();
closureFunc(); // 1
closureFunc(); // 2
closureFunc(); // 3

Debounce vs throttling 
Debounce is limit the execution of a function call and waits for a certain amount of time before running it again 
The throttle also limits function execution calls for ex it takes a 1-sec delay first it will execute the function immediately 
then wait 1sec and execute the function again so it will be continued to execute intervals of time 
Debounce is most suitable for control events like typing or button clicks
Throttle is most suitable for continued user events like resizing and scrolling 

Axios interceptors
Interceptors are a feature that allows an application to intercept requests or responses before they are handled by then or catch 
Ex token sends every request 

Event bubbling and capturing and 
event delegation and event.stopPropagation()
event bubbling is process when an element receives an event and that event bubbles up to its parent and ancestor elements on DOM until gets to the root element
Event capture phase opposite of bubbling, its parent to child
Event delegation is pattern to handle events efficiently. 
Instead of adding event listener to each and every smiler elements we can add event listener to parent element.
Call an event on particular target using event.target property to perform an event on every child of parent. 
For example we take Amazon website. It has several categories so we couldn’t add on click event on every category to navigate that category page. 
simply we can add event to parent element and call the event using property of event.target and 
it is capturing which element triggers than we can perform task on that element. 
event bubbling can be stopped by calling stopPropagation() on event object

Why use react
It uses VDOM
It uses the component architecture
It uses a modularize component 
We can build complex UI easily
It has a view library only
it has vast community and ecosystem
it has reusability and composition
it uses declarative syntax
react hooks simplified ecosystem

how to manage nested routes and role based routes?

reusability vs composition
reusability is create a component that can be used in multiple places. 
composition is combining simple reusable components together to build one big component. ex:App component

transpiler vs compiler
transpiler: converts code from one language to another language. ex: babel converts es6 to es5
compiler: converts code to machine readable format means high level programming language to low level machine code.

createContext

What is de-structure how can use arrays if the value change dynamic
de-structure is extract values from array/object and uses like variables

If two components shared the same username to display how will do in
saves in local storage

local storage vs session storage vs cookies
 	        Local Storage	    Session Storage	  Cookies
Capacity-->	5-10MB	          5MB	              4KB
Browsers-->	HTML 5	        HTML 5	          HTML 5 / HTML 4
Accessibility-->Any Window  Same Tab	      Any Window
performance--> synchronous  synchronous     asynchronous
Expiration-->	Never	On      Tab Close	      Manually Set 
Browser Support-->	Very High 
Supported Data Types-->	String Only 	
Auto-expire Option-->	No	 Yes	             Yes
Storage Location-->	Browser Only	Browser Only	Browser and Server
Editable and Blockable by Users-->	Yes
SSL Support-->  	No	      No	                Yes

Which is better local storage or session storage?
If we want some data on the browser, we often utilize the local storage object. Cookies are used if we want them on the server.
session storage is used if we want to delete the data if the user closes that particular tab or the season

Is Async a sessionStorage?
No, all localStorage and sessionStorage calls are synchronous

Position relative vs position absolute 
default value is static it's not effect layout
position: relative places an element relative to its current position without changing the layout around it, 
position: absolute places an element relative to its parent’s position and changing the layout around it.
position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, stays same place
position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.

Two separate div tags to display next to each other how can do that
using flex-box
one div inside another div displays inline property without affecting width and height

Servers side component 
when you render website HTML on server we can use SSR

Rules of hooks 
hooks can only be called inside functional component
hooks can be top level of component
hooks cannot be conditional

Npm vs yarn
NPM fetches packages from the online npm registry for every 'install' command
YARN stores dependencies locally in most cases and fetches packages from a local disk.

What are React hooks? Explain the difference between useState and useEffect.
React hooks are functions that allow you to use state and lifecycle features in functional components. 
useState is used to manage state, while useEffect is used to handle side effects like fetching data or subscribing to events.

Use context API
props passed to several components. this leads to prop drilling. 
avoid prop drilling use contextAPI allows data to be passed through a component tree without having to pass props manually at every level
createContext:function returns an object with provider and consumer properties
Context API consists of two main components:  provider and consumer
The provider is responsible for creating and managing the context, which holds the data
the consumer is used to access the context and its data
 Context API provides a way to share data between components without passing it through props. It's useful for managing global state. 
 You create a context using createContext and provide it at a higher level. Consumers can access the context using useContext.

Code Example:
const ThemeContext = createContext();

function App() {
 return (
 <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
 <Component />
 </ThemeContext.Provider>
 );
}

function Component() {
 const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
 // Use theme value here
}

custom hook
when you have component logic to be used by multiple components. we can extract logic place in custom hook.
the hook start with name 'useFetch' 'useOnline'  like  

Global execution contexts

props.children
children are a special prop that is used to pass the data from the parent component to the children component 
but this data must be enclosed within the parent’s opening and closing tag.

const Picture = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={props.src}/>
      {props.children}
    </div>
  )
}

//App.js
render () {
  return (
    <div className='container'>
      <Picture key={picture.id} src={picture.src}>
          //what is placed here is passed as props.children  
      </Picture>
    </div>
  )
}

How can you optimize performance in a React application? Discuss techniques like memoization, code splitting, and lazy loading.
Performance optimization techniques include memoization with useMemo and useCallback to avoid unnecessary recalculations, 
code splitting to split the bundle into smaller chunks to load components when needed. we can use lay loading and Suspense
react.lazy is function that allows you to load component lazily. it enables code splitting to import component asynchronous/dynamically.
Suspense is used to define loading state and render fallback UI while component is loading.
pros and cons of code splitting
faster initial loading, optimized bandwidth usage,improve caching, parallel loading,easier maintaining
complexity, tooling dependency, potential for run time errors,increased number of requests

useCallback and useMemo
useCallback and useMemo are both React Hooks that help optimize the performance of a React application by memoizing technique.

When you define a function inside a component, it is recreated on every render, even if the component’s state or props have not changed. 
This can lead to unnecessary re-renders, which can slow down your application’s performance. 
The useCallback hook helps you avoid this problem by memoizing the function and only recreating it when necessary.
When you need to pass a function as props to a child component.
If you have a function that is expensive to compute and you need to call it in multiple places.
When dealing with functional components.
When you are working with a function that relies on external data or state.
The useCallback hook takes two arguments: a function and a dependency array. 
It will return a memoized version of the function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed.
useMemo is used to memoize values or computations, helping to optimize expensive calculations or data transformations.u
useCallback returns a memoized callback function, while useMemo returns a memoized value.
useCallback(callback, dependencies)
What is the hook? Life cycle methods vs hooks
React hooks are functions that allow you to use state and lifecycle features in functional components. 
Hooks can be stateful and can manage side effects. React hooks provide a more concise way to manage state and side effects in functional components. 
Lifecycle methods are only available in class components

functional components vs class Components
A functional component is just a plain JavaScript pure function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element(JSX).
A class component requires you to extend from React.Component and create a render function that returns a React element. 
There is no render method used in functional components. React hooks provide a more concise way to manage state and side effects in functional components.

reactive programming
it is programming approach focuses on reactive to change and events in a declarative and asynchronous manner.

Unidirectional flow in react
In React JS, data flows in one direction, from Parent to Child. This helps components to be simple and predictable. 
Data passed through Props it's properties passed to a child component that can hold information.

Mounting in react
Mounting means putting elements into the DOM. It occurs when a component is first added to a page

Mounting vs render
Mounting occurs when a component is first added to the page, while rendering occurs when a component's state changes.

package.json vs package.lock.json
The “package.json” file defines the rules required to run your application and install dependencies. 
the “package-lock.json” file holds detailed information on all the dependencies on your project.

Function composition 
it is a approach one function result on to pass next function until final function executes get results
function composition can be composed of any number of functions

React dom
ReactDOM is the JavaScript library that allows React to interact with the DOM. 

React dom server
The ReactDOMServer object enables you to render components to static markup (typically used on node server).
This object is mainly used for server-side rendering (SSR)

ReactMixins

Diffing algorithm is VDOM reconciliation process
React scripts react-scripts are simply scripts to run the build tools required to transform React JSX syntax into plain JavaScript programmatically
Concurrent rendering 

Use effect vs use layout effect 
useEffect() is asynchronous useLayoutEffect() synchronous 
useLayoutEffect() code always comes before useEffect()
useEffect() flickering or produce inaccurate results then useLayoutEffect() useful hook

1.what are new tags of html5?
there are several tags. 
some of the tags are aside,article,datalist,canvas,date,datetime,audio,video,color inputs are some of new tags.

2.should we inject div tag inside of span tag?
yes, div is block scope and span is inline tag but schematically wrong it will break in production

3.5 ways center align image inside div?
flex box,grid,table css,margin css, position css

4.px vs em vs rem?
px is absolute value and it is  fixed size
em is scalable elements that needs to change size relative to parent element
rem is scalable responsive layout that needs to change size relative to root element

5.name all basic data types?
there are two types one is primitive and another is non-primitive
primitive--string,boolean,number,null,undefined,bigint,symbol
non-primitive--array,object,date

6.what is event delegation and bubbling and capturing?
event delegation is pattern to handle events efficiently.
Instead of add event listener to each and every similar element we can add event to parent element. 
call an event on particular target using event.target property of object to perform a task
bubbling--when element receives event happens its bubbles up to parent element and ancestor element on dom until get root element
capturing is opposite of bubbling

7.what is closure and uses?
closure is combination of function bundled together with reference to surrounding state. it means lexical environment
simply means a child function can access parent scope even if parent function closed.
usages memorization and currying

8.what is need of js frameworks?
to help you to design web applications. it has flexibility and scalable and code readability and plugins and builds-->production,development... 

9.VDOM vs DOM?
DOM is document object modal and it represents document tree structure of HTML
React follows observable pattern
VDOM is memory representation of DOM means exact copy of DOM
if react changes state in component and it update VDOM but not in DOM.
after updating react compares previous version of VDOM and current version of VDOM
react knows exactly which nodes changed in VDOM.those nodes only changed in real DOM
this process is reconciliation process. it uses diffing algorithm. VDOM is faster because of making minimal manipulating operations on realDOM

10.component lifecycle methods and order?
there phases mounting and updating and unmounting
constructor
getderivedstatefromprops
shouldcomponentupdate
render
componentdidmount
componentdidupdate
componentwillunmount

11.pure components vs HOC components?
pure components work like functional components there is one difference that is shouldcomponentupdate lifecycle method.
it is checking on every render shallow comparison of state and props if it difference should render component other wise should not
HOC is component it takes another component as argument and returns new component. it is pattern from compositional nature
we don't modify components we create new ones
it is useful for code reuse
props manipulating
it is pure function. It ha no side effects. return new components only
for example show loading when user fetching data so wa can create HOC achieve it
react-redux --> connect
react-router--> withRouter
material-ui-->	withStyles(styles)(UserPage)

12.HOF functions?
HOF takes function as argument returns another function. they enable us abstract over actions not values
for example map,foreach,filter

13.state vs props vs ref?
state is object that stores information and owned by component and locally scoped
state can mutable via setState
props is object that have information
props passing down child components and it immutable
ref are accessing DOM elements without using selector methods of the document object
the main difference when state updates than component re-renders but in useRef we can access DOM elements without re-rendering component
ref create like useRef hook createRef using class-based components
use-cases of refs are maintaining input focus,text selection,media controls,outside dom,wth third party libraries

14.version of react?
react 18 features for automatic batch updates, useTransition startTransition  A transition is a new concept in React to distinguish between urgent and non-urgent updates.
support for Suspense on the server,New Strict Mode Behaviors, new hooks

15.functional component vs class component?
functional component is pure functional in javascript
we can maintaining stateful using hooks 
class component extend from react and it has render method return children and class component has lifecycle methods

16.Why it is Recommended to use Functional Components over Class Components?
simplicity
performance
code readability
easier to test
we can make stateful and lifecycle methods using hooks

17.Is the Shadow DOM the same as the Virtual DOM?
No, they are different. The Shadow DOM is a browser technology designed primarily for scoping variables and CSS in web components. designed for encapsulation
Shadow DOM allows hidden DOM trees to be attached to elements in the regular DOM tree this shadow DOM tree starts with a shadow root
const shadowOpen = elementRef.attachShadow({ mode: "open" });
const shadowClosed = elementRef.attachShadow({ mode: "closed" });
Shadow DOM is particularly useful when creating custom elements.
The virtual DOM is a concept implemented by libraries in JavaScript on top of browser APIs.

18.what are fragments?
return multiple elements from component by allowing us to group list of children without adding extra node on DOM

19.react fiber?
react fiber is re-implementation of react core algorithm. that is reconciliation main goal is ability to pause and resume and reuse work.
incremental rendering and break down rendering tasks to small chunks and distribute across the numerous frames.
it more suitable for layout and gestures and animation

20.how can maintaining data in complex ui?
using redux maintaining external global single store to achieve
contextAPI

21.two way data binding implementation?
use callback to achieve it

22.pure functions?
a function has always returns same if we pass same arguments. it is not depend on any state

23. promise and async&await?
promises makes a asynchronous operation either resolve or reject.
previous we are using callbacks to achieve asynchronous operation. writing multiple callbacks inside callback will create callback hell
to avoid callback hell promises are introduced. creating new promise and it returns promise object
promise function  takes resolve and reject arguments
it has three states 1.pending 2.fulfilled 3.reject
initial stage to execute function
when promise resolve it will fulfilled
if reject it will reject
we consume output we use then and catch then used resolve callback catch used reject callback
promise chain is passing return value to then to another then and soon is called promise chain
async/await is shorter syntax of promise 
write async keyword function before and await waiting either resolve or reject
we catch errors using try and catch

24.how to 5 api calls parallel?
promise.all([])

25.what happens background when enter url and hit enter?
each website has ip than ip locate DNS server and DNS locates to web server then fetch website from server

26.what is hoisting and scope
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
if we declared with var is hoisted and default value assigned as undefined
Function declarations are hoisted not function expressions.
Function hoisting allows us to call a function before it is defined
scope-- block scope if the variable is declared in code block that variable visible in that code block
lexical environment scope

27.service workers and pwa?
it is script that browser runs background separate from web page
service workers act as proxy between web browser and web server.
they aim to readability by providing offline access as well as boost web page performance
Service workers are at the core of progressive web applications.
pwa has modern web capability to delivery to app experience to users
pwa can run multiple platforms from single code base
pwa support offline and it will install on device and faster loading and user interactions

28.prototype and prototype chain?

29.HTML?
hypertext is text that is organized order to connect related items it comes from hyperlink
markup is style guide it defined elements and elements will be page layout 
language is combines both features make HTML

30.hyperlink?
<a> tag defines hyperlink. which is used to link between one page to another

31.HTML entity
some characters are reserved in HTML we can show in web page we can use entity name or entity number ex &lt or &#60 to display < symbol
used for non-breaking space

32.input type submit vs button in html
<input type="submit"> cause the form data to be submitted to the server
<button> can have content, whereas <input> cannot (it is a null element).


33.callbacks
callback is a function passed another function to execute results. make asynchronous operations we can use callbacks
ex setTimeout(cb,time), addEventListener('click',cb)

34.callbacks vs HOF
A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function.

A higher order function is a function that takes function as an argument and returns a function as an output.
ex filter,map

35.What is Lifting State Up in React?
We lift the state up to make the parent state a single shared state and pass the parent's data to its children. 
This concept is called lifting state up. maintain data consistency throughout applications.

36.What is Hot Module Replacement?
allows you to make changes to your code and immediately see the results. without losing the current state of the app.
 without a full reload.

 36.What is the use of Parcel, Vite, Webpack?
 bundling all the js files together

37.How does create-react-app work?
create-react-app (CRA), your command runs through a series of checks. It finds information about your system and run program

38.What is Tree Shaking?
dead code elimination means if unused modules in application webpack will eliminate and not remove code 

39.Difference b/w dependency and devDependency
"dependencies" : Packages required by your application in production. 
"devDependencies" : Packages that are only needed for local development and testing.

40.npm vs npx
NPM is a package manager used to install, delete, and update Javascript packages on your machine. 
NPX is a package executer, and it is used to execute javascript packages directly, without installing them.

41.Difference between console.log(<HeaderComponent/>) and console.log(HeaderComponent())

42. What if 2 components are given will the state change in one component will effect the other component’s state (child)?
no,it will not re-render. If you pass any props to the component from the parent component and you update that prop in children
or that prop update in the parent component so both will re-render. 
But if the data or state has no dependency on the parent component so it will not cause a re-render in the parent component.

43.What is the use of return in useEffect ?
removing EventListener

44.Difference b/w client-side routing and server-side routing?

45.How does React handle routing and navigation?
 react-router-dom library
 React Router provides a <Link> component, which can be used for basic React navigation
 
46.contextAPI vs redux
 Context API is a light-weight solution which is more suited for passing data from a parent to a deeply nested child.
 Redux is a more robust State Management solution.

47.Can I replace Redux with context API?
If you're only using Redux to avoid passing down props, you can replace it with Context API. 
Context is great for sharing trivial pieces of state between components. 
Redux is much more powerful and hooks provides a set of handy features that Context doesn't have
It's great for managing centralized state and handling API requests.

48.Difference Between Context API and Redux
The main difference between these two libraries is that Redux deals with changes of the state in a centralized manner. 
On the other hand, Context deals with them as they happen on the component level.

49.difference of function statement and function expression
hoisting is happens in function statement not in function expression

50.block level element vs inline level element
block level element will take full width and height of the parent element
ex: <header>,<nav>,<section>,<article>,<aside>,<footer>,<main>
inline level element will take only the space required to display the content
ex: <a>,<span>,<strong>,<em>,<b>,,<label>,<img>,<input>,<br>,<script>

redux vs contextAPI
Context is not a "state management" tool. It's a Dependency Injection mechanism
Redux is a library and a pattern for separating your state update logic from the rest of your app
Context is a great tool by itself, and I use it frequently in my own apps. But, Context doesn't "replace Redux".

Concurrency modal in js
it is a process of running multiple tasks at the same time. in js it is achieved by using the asynchronous programming and event loop
