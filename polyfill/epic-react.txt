optimization
  -- import(/* webpackPrefetch: true */'./pageA.js')
Modules that are prefetched are requested and loaded by the browser even before the user requested the resource. 
When the browser is idle and calculates that it’s got enough bandwidth, it will make a request in order to load the resource, and cache it.
Having the resource cached can reduce the loading time significantly, as we don’t have to wait for the request to finish after the user has clicked the button. 
It can simply get the loaded resource from cache. prefetching is a great way to optimize the loading time.
if user not requested that time waste of resource. Only prefetch the necessary resources.

  --react.memo 
let menu = React.memo(menu,(prevProps,nextProps)=>{}) return true component doesn't render.return false will render
This makes us want to use React.memo for various components, but memoization is also costly. 
The second argument of React.memo is a function that compares whether the previous props and the new props are the same
