// Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time."

// "You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.
// A concatenated substring in s is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.
// For example, if words = [""""ab"""",""""cd"""",""""ef""""], then """"abcdef"""", """"abefcd"""", """"cdabef"""", """"cdefab"""", """"efabcd"""", and """"efcdab"""" are all concatenated strings. """"acdbef"""" is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.
// Return the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. You can return the answer in any order.
// Input: s = """"barfoothefoobarman"""", words = [""""foo"""",""""bar""""]
// Output: [0,9]
// Explanation: Since words.length == 2 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.
// The substring starting at 0 is """"barfoo"""". It is the concatenation of [""""bar"""",""""foo""""] which is a permutation of words.
// The substring starting at 9 is """"foobar"""". It is the concatenation of [""""foo"""",""""bar""""] which is a permutation of words.
// The output order does not matter. Returning [9,0] is fine too."
