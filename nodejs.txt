Here are some ways to optimize Node.js performance:

Use caching: Reduce latency by caching your app 
Use a load balancer: Use a load balancer to scale to multiple machines 
Use timeouts: Use timeouts to manage I/O operations 
Use Worker Threads: Run JavaScript code in separate threads to offload CPU-intensive tasks 
Use the Cluster Module: Create multiple worker processes to run on separate CPU cores 
Use HTTP/2: Enable SSL/TLS encryption and use a web server that supports HTTP/2 
Optimize database queries: Optimize database queries to minimize disk accesses 
Use asynchronous programming: Use asynchronous programming to optimize operations 
Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN): Use a CDN to improve performance 
Reduce dependencies: Reduce the number of dependencies 
Streamline code: Streamline your code 
Use profiling and monitoring tools: Use profiling and monitoring tools to track and analyze your app data 
Manage memory and CPU usage: Manage memory and CPU usage to ensure your app remains fast and responsive 

What Is Replication In MongoDB?
Replication in MongoDB involves creating multiple copies of data across different servers, known as replica sets. 
This process enhances read capacity by allowing clients to distribute read operations across these replica sets. 
Storing data copies across various data centers improves data localization and availability for distributed applications. 
Additionally, maintaining surplus copies serves specific purposes such as backup, reporting, and disaster recovery.

What is Sharding in MongoDB?
Sharding is a method in MongoDB that distributes data across multiple machines to support large data sets and high throughput operations.
advantages: Increased storage capacity, Increased read/write throughput, High availability, and Efficient scaling

What is the purpose of MongoDB?
MongoDB serves as a document-oriented database manager. 
It stores data in a binary JSON format and incorporates the concepts of collections and documents. 
Being a cross-platform, NoSQL database, MongoDB is distinguished by its high performance, scalability, and flexibility, 
enabling smooth querying and indexing operations.

What is the purpose of ExpressJS?
ExpressJS is a web application as an open-source framework. 
ExpressJS adeptly the interaction between the front-end and the database, ensuring a secure and seamless data transfer.

does MongoDB supports foreign key constrains?
no, NoSQL database it is up to you decide how to organized data

What is aggregation in NoSQL or MongoDB?
MongoDB aggregation queries are operations that group and transform data from one or more collections or documents in a MongoDB database.
They can perform tasks such as filtering, sorting, counting, averaging, summing, or joining data across different fields.

What is Mongoose?
Mongoose is Object Data Modeling (ODM) library built for MongoDB.
Mongoose simplifies database management and interactions with its intuitive API, for building scalable and maintainable applications.

what is eventemitter in node js
In Node.js, EventEmitter is a core module that facilitates the implementation of the Observer pattern, 
enabling communication between different parts of your application through events.
