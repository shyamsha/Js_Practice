1.What are the major features of React?
A)1.it uses VDOM.
  2.it uses jsx like xml syntax.
  3.it support server-side-rendering.
  4.it follows the unidirectional.
  5. we can create reusable code as much as well.

2.What is the difference between Element and Component?
A) we can use React.createElement() to create HTML Elements
   where as Component is simplified JSX Component like class and functional Components

3.What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?
A) callback is invoked when setState() function is finished. so setState() is
   a asynchoruns then we can use callback for any post action.

4.How to pass a parameter to an event handler or callback?
A)1.<div onClick={()=>this.handler(id)}>onClick</div>
  2.<div onClick={this.handler.bind(id)}>onClick</div>

5.What are synthetic events in React?
A) synthetic event wrapper around cross browser native event.

6.What are Higher-Order Components?
A) it takes a one or more Components as parameter and return a new Component.
   the Component rendering original Component that we passes to it

7.what is children props?
A) children props are special props when we pass Component as data to other Components

8.where can use this.props.children?
A) it used to display data between opening tag and closing tag instead of self closing tag
   ex. <Component>data</Component> instead of <Component/>

9.what are the decorates?
A)

10.How to define constants in React?
A) using static and it is work with React.createClass()
   class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  static DEFAULT_PAGINATION = 10
}

11.what are render props?
A) it is pattern for using share code between components
   <MyComponent render={props=><h1>{props.name}</h1>}/>

12.How to pass params to history.push method in React Router v4?
A) this.props.history.push({
  pathname: '/template',
  search: '?name=syam',
  state: { detail: response.data }
})

13. what are webpack and babel?
A) webpack and babel tools for developer that optimizing javascript applications

webpack is module bundler we can use minify multiple files in javascript and increase overall efficiency. 
a modular bundler takes all assets comes up with single output file that making more light weight project.

for babel it is syntax converter and transpiler. the code to be compatible with all browsers and environments. 
in such instances we can uses babel and it turns latest javascript code into ES5 this makes all browsers compatible.

transpiler and polyfill

A transpiler is a special piece of software that translates one source code to another source code.
It can parse modern code and rewrite it using older syntax constructs, so that it’ll also work in outdated browsers.

example --> nullish is modern in js  height = user?.height it may fail outdated browsers.
A transpiler would analyze our code and rewrite user?.height into (user.height !== undefined && user.height !== null) ? user.height : undefined

Polyfills
New language features may include not only syntax constructs and operators, but also built-in functions that might not be supported on older browsers.
Math.cbrt(n), for example, is a function that returns the cube root of a number, but it may not be supported by older browsers, in which case this method will fail.

Polyfill is a script that updates/adds new functions. It bridges the gap and adds missing implementations if needed.

For this particular case, the polyfill for Math.cbrt is a script that implements it, like this:

if (!Math.cbrt) { // if no such function
  // implement it
  Math.cbrt = function(number) {
    // Math.pow exist even in ancient JavaScript engines
    return Math.pow(number,0.33);
  };
}
